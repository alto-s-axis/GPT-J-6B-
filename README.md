# GPT-J-6B-
learn, experiment, testing ,build,  deploy and use = fun! 

GPT -j  from Eluether Ai don't need any intro so let's jump into learning
i am using colab because gpt-j require a huge system to run and colab provide most of requirment for free
although we can run gpt-j on almost any modern mid range system but it can cost a lot of time, gpt-j require huge vram or cpu ram if gpu is not available but running on gpu with at least 16Gb is recommendade.
